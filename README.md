# Found Item

Clicking "Found Item" will prompt a pop up for the item name that will stop the current run and add the item to the list with the associated run number.

By checking "Grail Only", it only attempts to add the item to your grail, but doesnt add to the runs list of items.

# Save/Load

You can save the current run session statistics to your local computer as a CSV file, which can then be imported any time to resume the session (Holy Grail saves automatically when anything changes to the local profile's database).

# Holy Grail

You can track your progress of the items you've found as well as the date you found them. When you click "Found Item" in a run, it will automatically check your profile's database to see if you have found the item and if not, add it to your collection.

If you're not in a run, you can add an item to your holy grail with "Add to Grail" (Also accessible from the overlay).

You can filter the list of all items by Found, Not Found, by Category (Unique, Set, Runewords, Runes) or search the item.

# Profiles

You will be prompted to create a profile when first launching the app. The profile will keep track of your Holy Grail statistics and you can create multiple (Ladder/Non-Ladder etc..)

# Upgrade to newer version (Keep profile's database/items)
You are able to upgrade to a newer version of Run Counter while keeping your profile's database and items.  

First, navigate to the install directory (C:\Users\\(username)\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0) and Copy/Paste the Database file of the Profile Names that you would like to save to another location.

Then, perform the following steps:

1. Uninstall the current version.  
2. Install the new version.  
	2.1 Create a new profile with the new version.  
3. Navigate to the install directory (C:\Users\\(username)\AppData\Local\Apps\2.0).  
	3.1 If the profile name you created in 2.1 is the same as your old version, overwrite the database of the previous version with the new version.  
	3.2 If you have a new profile name, delete the database file you created in 2.1, then replace it with your previous database, renaming it to the profile name created in 2.1.  
	
This will update your new version of Run Counter with your old profile's database and items.
